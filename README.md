## VsCode extensions 

- DotEnv: to highlight environmental variables in a .n file
- ESLint: is useful to find bugs in our code
- image preview: preview image in a small figure at the very lefthand side of your code
- Prettier - code formater: auto format our code
- Pug beautify: Pug is a language we use for building template; so, it is important to have this extension when working with Pug
- TabNine: does a nice magic autocompletion 
- TODO Highlight
- Theme - Oceanic Next: it is just the theme that I use

## Configuration for Prettier - code formater

- We create a file: .prettierrc 
- Inside the file, write: {"sngleQuote": true}   // it will automatically change the duble quotes to single quote
- more configurations: https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html
